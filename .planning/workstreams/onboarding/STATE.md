## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 28 backend shipped as-is — no backend changes in v1.0
- `client_data` doc type deferred — no target table in v1.0
- IA classifier runs client-side (to be confirmed during plan-phase)
- Only `coach_template` docs are committed via `PUT /coach/imports/:id/commit`
- Step 4 is optional — skip gate goes directly to `/coach/dashboard`
